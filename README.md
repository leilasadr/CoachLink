## Description

CoachLink is an application that connects ski and snowboard instructors with opportunities to teach at different clubs. Any user can create a gig (teaching opportunity) which is then hosted on the application, and any user can apply to a gig by browsing through possible opportunities. 

The ski and snowboard community is fairly spread-out, so discoverability of teaching opportunities is what this app aims to provide. Additionally this app addresses the goal of reducing barriers to beginners from all backgrounds so more people can access the ski and snowboard community with expert instruction from passionate professionals already part of the community.
